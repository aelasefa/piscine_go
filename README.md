## 🧠 About the Piscine

The Go Piscine is a full-time, high-intensity program where we dive into the fundamentals of **Go programming**.  
It's focused on autonomous learning, peer collaboration, and practical coding skills.

- ✅ Functions, packages, and error handling
- ✅ Arrays, slices, maps, and structs
- ✅ Recursion and algorithms
- ✅ File I/O and command-line tools
- ✅ Unit testing with Go's built-in testing package
- ✅ Writing clean, idiomatic Go code
